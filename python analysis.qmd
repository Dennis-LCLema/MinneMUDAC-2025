# **Big Brothers Big Sisters Twin Cities Match Analysis**

## **Project Overview**
This analysis explores match longevity and success within the **Big Brothers Big Sisters Twin Cities (BBBS-TC)** mentoring program. Using historical match data, we aim to identify **key factors influencing match retention, closure reasons, and overall success rates**.

### **Key Objectives**
- **Understand Match Length Distribution**: How long do matches typically last, and what trends emerge?
- **Program Type Comparison**: Do certain mentoring programs lead to longer or more successful matches?
- **Demographic Influences**: How do factors such as gender identity affect match duration?
- **Match Success Rate**: What percentage of matches achieve a successful closure, and what factors contribute to this outcome?

### **Key Findings**
- Most matches **end within the first 20 months**, with **Community-Based programs** showing the longest retention.
- **Gender differences in match length** exist, with variations in retention for **Genderqueer/Nonbinary and Trans mentors**.
- **The match success rate is low (~10%)**, highlighting potential retention challenges.

### **Implications**
Understanding these patterns can help BBBS-TC:
- Improve **match retention strategies**.
- Enhance **support systems for mentors and mentees**.
- Develop **data-driven policies** to foster long-term, impactful mentoring relationships.

The following sections provide a deeper analysis of these findings, supported by visualizations and data-driven insights.

| **Big Occupation**        | Profession of the mentor. |
| **Match Activation Date** | The date the match officially started. |
| **Match Closure Date**    | The date the match ended. |

### **Data Cleaning & Preparation**
To ensure accurate analysis, the following preprocessing steps were applied:
- **Converted date variables** to proper datetime format for time-based analysis.
- **Filtered relevant columns** to focus on **match length, closure reasons, and demographic factors**.
- **Handled missing values**, ensuring that null or ambiguous data points were not included in statistical computations.
- **Categorized closure reasons** to define **successful vs. unsuccessful matches**.

### **Why This Data Matters**
By analyzing these variables, we can:
- Identify **predictors of long-lasting matches**.
- Understand **why matches end early** and how to improve retention.
- Develop **targeted strategies** to improve match success rates.

```{python, echo=false}
# Define the file path
file_path = r"C:\Users\Dennis Campoverde-Le\Desktop\Academic\DataCompetition\MinneMUDAC2025\Novice (1).xlsx"

# Load the Excel file
xls = pd.ExcelFile(file_path)

# Show available sheets
print("Available Sheets:", xls.sheet_names)

# Load the first sheet into a DataFrame
df = pd.read_excel(xls, sheet_name='Sheet1')

# Display first few rows
df.head()

```

```{python, echo=false}
# Select relevant columns for analysis
relevant_columns = [
    'Match Length', 'Closure Reason', 'Program Type', 'Big Gender', 'Little Gender',
    'Big Age', 'Little Birthdate', 'Big Race/Ethnicity', 'Little Participant: Race/Ethnicity',
    'Big Occupation', 'Match Activation Date', 'Match Closure Meeting Date'
]

df_relevant = df[relevant_columns].copy()  # Avoid SettingWithCopyWarning

# Convert date columns
date_columns = ['Match Activation Date', 'Match Closure Meeting Date', 'Little Birthdate']
for col in date_columns:
    df_relevant.loc[:, col] = pd.to_datetime(df_relevant[col], errors='coerce')

# Display info to verify data types
df_relevant.info()

```

## **Match Length Distribution Analysis**

The histogram below illustrates the **distribution of match lengths** (in months) for Big Brothers Big Sisters Twin Cities (BBBS-TC). 

### **Key Observations**
- The distribution is **right-skewed**, meaning most matches tend to be **shorter in duration**, with fewer long-term matches.
- A **high frequency of matches** fall within the **0-20 month range**, suggesting many matches do not last beyond two years.
- The **mode** (most frequent match length) appears to be **around 10-15 months**.
- The **tail of the distribution extends beyond 60 months**, indicating a **small number of long-lasting matches**.
- The **density plot overlay (blue line)** provides a smooth approximation of the data, confirming that match lengths decrease as duration increases.

### **Potential Implications**
- Identifying **factors that contribute to early closures** (e.g., volunteer availability, child engagement) could help improve match retention.
- Since **longer match durations** correlate with greater positive youth outcomes, strategies to **extend match longevity** should be explored.
- Further analysis on **demographics, program type, and closure reasons** can reveal **predictors of successful, long-term matches**.


```{python, echo=false}
# Set up figure
plt.figure(figsize=(10,5))
sns.histplot(df_relevant['Match Length'].dropna(), bins=30, kde=True)
plt.title("Distribution of Match Length")
plt.xlabel("Match Length (Months)")
plt.ylabel("Frequency")
plt.show()

```

## **Match Length Across Program Types**

The box plot below visualizes **match length distribution** across different **program types** in Big Brothers Big Sisters Twin Cities (BBBS-TC).

### **Key Observations**
- **Community-Based Matches** tend to last the longest, with a **median duration around 20 months** and many matches extending beyond **80+ months**.
- **Site-Based Programs (Site & Site-Based Facilitated)** show **shorter match durations**, with the median below **10-15 months**. This suggests that **site-based matches are more temporary** compared to community-based matches.
- **Site-Based Plus** shows a **higher median match length** than standard site-based programs, suggesting that additional engagement factors may help sustain longer-lasting mentorship.
- **Outliers** (dots above whiskers) are observed in all categories but are **more prominent in Community-Based Programs**, indicating that some matches last significantly longer than the typical range.

### **Potential Implications**
- **Community-based programs** may be more **sustainable for long-term mentorship**, possibly due to more flexible, personal interactions beyond structured settings.
- **Shorter durations in site-based programs** could be due to **school calendar constraints, location-based dependencies, or fewer opportunities for informal bonding**.
- **Further investigation** into **retention strategies** for site-based programs may help **increase match longevity**.


```{python, echo=false}
plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))
sns.boxplot(x="Program Type", y="Match Length", data=df_relevant)
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.title("Match Length Across Program Types")
plt.show()

```

## **Match Length by Big's Gender**

The box plot below illustrates **match length distributions** based on the gender identity of the **Bigs (mentors)** in the Big Brothers Big Sisters Twin Cities (BBBS-TC) program.

### **Key Observations**
- **Male and Female Bigs** have **similar distributions**, with median match lengths around **15-20 months**.
- **Matches with Male Bigs** tend to last slightly longer, with a **higher upper quartile** and **more matches extending beyond 80+ months**.
- **Genderqueer/Nonbinary and Trans Male Bigs** show **shorter median match lengths**, with most matches **falling under 20 months**.
- **Bigs who marked "Prefer not to say" or "Trans Female"** had significantly **fewer recorded matches**, making their distributions less reliable for comparison.
- **Outliers** (dots above whiskers) indicate **some exceptionally long-lasting matches**, mostly among Male and Female Bigs.

### **Potential Implications**
- **The longer durations for Male and Female Bigs** may be due to **higher participation rates** and **more established mentoring structures**.
- **Shorter durations for Genderqueer/Nonbinary and Trans Bigs** might indicate **challenges in long-term retention**, potentially due to **availability, support systems, or representation**.
- **Further research into mentoring experiences across gender identities** could help **improve match longevity and inclusivity**.


```{python, echo=false}
plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))
sns.boxplot(x="Big Gender", y="Match Length", data=df_relevant)
plt.title("Match Length by Big's Gender")
plt.show()

```


## **Match Length by Little's Gender**

The box plot below illustrates the **distribution of match lengths** based on the gender identity of the **Littles (mentees)** in the Big Brothers Big Sisters Twin Cities (BBBS-TC) program.

### **Key Observations**
- **Male and Female Littles** have **similar median match lengths**, around **15-20 months**, but Male Littles show a slightly wider range of match durations.
- **Genderqueer/Nonbinary Littles** tend to have slightly **longer median match lengths**, though the sample size appears smaller.
- **Trans Male Littles** have **shorter match durations**, with fewer long-term matches and a lower overall range.
- **Outliers** are visible across all gender categories, especially among Male and Female Littles, indicating that some matches last significantly longer than the median.

### **Potential Implications**
- The relatively **consistent match lengths across gender categories** suggest that **mentoring relationships are not significantly impacted by gender identity alone**.
- The **shorter durations for Trans Male Littles** could indicate **unique challenges** in maintaining long-term mentoring relationships, such as availability of matched Bigs or external factors affecting retention.
- **Further analysis** could explore whether specific support structures or mentoring approaches contribute to **longer match retention** for Littles of different gender identities.


```{python, echo=false}
plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))
sns.boxplot(x="Little Gender", y="Match Length", data=df_relevant)
plt.title("Match Length by Little's Gender")
plt.show()

```


## **Match Success Rate**

The bar chart below illustrates the proportion of **successful vs. unsuccessful matches** in the Big Brothers Big Sisters Twin Cities (BBBS-TC) program.

### **Key Observations**
- **The majority of matches (~90%) are classified as "Unsuccessful,"** meaning they did not meet the criteria for success (i.e., "Successful Match Closure" or "Child Graduated").
- **Only a small proportion of matches (~10%) are classified as "Successful,"** indicating that relatively few matches persist until a recognized successful closure.

### **Potential Explanations**
- Matches may be **ending prematurely** due to external factors such as:
  - Volunteer time constraints or relocation.
  - Child or family disengagement.
  - Structural barriers in certain program types.
- The **low success rate** suggests that **match retention strategies** should be examined:
  - What factors contribute to **longer-lasting, successful matches**?
  - Are there demographic or program-based differences in success rates?
  - How can BBBS-TC **support matches** to increase retention?

### **Next Steps for Analysis**
- Investigate **match duration trends**—do longer matches have higher success rates?
- Assess **closure reasons** in unsuccessful matches to identify common patterns.
- Explore **predictors of success**, including demographics, program type, and mentor-mentee alignment.


```{python, echo=false}
# Convert date columns
date_columns = ['Match Activation Date', 'Match Closure Meeting Date', 'Little Birthdate']
for col in date_columns:
    df_relevant.loc[:, col] = pd.to_datetime(df_relevant[col], errors='coerce')

# Define successful match closure reasons based on new information
successful_closures = ["Successful match closure", "Child: Graduated"]

# Create a new column for match success (True/False)
df_relevant["Successful Match"] = df_relevant["Closure Reason"].isin(successful_closures)

# Plot the match success rate
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))
sns.countplot(x="Successful Match", data=df_relevant)
plt.title("Match Success Rate")
plt.xticks(ticks=[0, 1], labels=["Unsuccessful", "Successful"])
plt.ylabel("Count")
